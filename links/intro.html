<h2><font face="Century">Introduction of Phishing
    Attacks</font></h2>
<p align=justify>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#000080">&nbsp;Phishing is a new type of network attack where the
    attacker creates a replica of an existing Web page to fool users
    (e.g., by using specially designed e-mails or instant messages)
    into submitting personal, financial, or password data to what
    they think is their service provides' Web site. In this paper, we
    propose a new end-host based anti-phishing algorithm, which
    we call LinkGuard, by utilizing the generic characteristics of
    the hyperlinks in phishing attacks. These characteristics are
    derived by analyzing the phishing data archive provided by the
    Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). Because it is based on
    the generic characteristics of phishing attacks, LinkGuard can
    detect not only known but also unknown phishing attacks. We
    have implemented LinkGuard in Windows XP. Our experiments
    verified that LinkGuard is effective to detect and prevent both
    known and unknown phishing attacks with minimal false negatives.
    LinkGuard successfully detects 195 out of the 203 phishing
    attacks. Our experiments also showed that LinkGuard is lightweighted
    and can detect and prevent phishing attacks in realtime.</font></p>

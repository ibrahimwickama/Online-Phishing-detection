<h2><font face="Century">Introduction of Phishing
    Attacks</font></h2>
<p align=justify>
    <font color="#000080">We classified the hyperlinks used in the
        phishing e-mail into the following categories:<br><br>
        1) The hyperlink provides DNS domain names in the
        anchor text, but the destination DNS name in the visible
        link doesn't match that in the actual link. For instance,
        the following hyperlink:
    </font>
    <font color="#800080">&lt;a href= "http://www.profusenet.net/checksession.php">
        https://secure.regionset.com/EBanking/logon/&lt;/a&gt;
    </font>
    <font color="#000080">appears to be linked to secure.regionset.com, which
        is the portal of a bank, but it actually is linked to a
        phishing site www.profusenet.net.<br><br>
        2) Dotted decimal IP address is used directly in the URI
        or the anchor text instead of DNS name. See below for
        an example.</font><font color="#800080">&lt;a href= "http://61.129.33.105/secured-site/www.skyfi.
    com/ index.html?MfclSAPICommand=SignInFPP&
    UsingSSL= 1"> SIGN IN&lt;/a&gt;</font><font color="#000080"><br><br>
    3) The hyperlink is counterfeited maliciously by using
    certain encoding schemes. There are two cases: a)
    The link is formed by encoding alphabets into their
    corresponding ASCII codes. See below for such a
    hyperlink.
</font>
    <font color="#800080">&lt;a href="http://034%02E%0333%34%2E%311%39%355%2E
        %o340o31:%34%39%30%33/%6C/%69%6E%64%65%78
        %2E%68%74%6D"> www.citibank.com &lt;/a&gt;</font><font color="#000080">
    while this link is seemed pointed www.citibank.com, it
    actually points to http://4.34.195.41:34/l/index.htm.<br>
    b) Special characters (e.g. ( in the visible link) are
    used to fool the user to believe that the e-mail is from a
    trusted sender. For instance, the following link seems is
    linked to amazon, but it actually is linked to IP address
    69.10.142.34.
    http://www.amazon.com:fvthsgbljhfcs83infoupdate
    @69.10.142.34.<br><br>
    4) The hyperlink does not provide destination information
    in its anchor text and uses DNS names in its URI. The
    DNS name in the URI usually is similar with a famous
    company or organization. For instance, the following
    link seems to be sent from paypal, but it actually is not.
    Since paypal-cgi is actually registered by the phisher
    to let the users believe that it has something to do with
    paypal
</font>
    <font color="#800080">&lt;a href= "http://www.paypal-cgi.us/webscr.php?
        cmd=LogIn"> Click here to confirm your account
        &lt;/a&gt;<br><br>
    </font>
    <font color="#000080">5) The attackers utilize the vulnerabilities of the
        target Web site to redirect users to their phishing sites or to launch CSS
        (cross site scripting) attacks. For example, the following link </font>
    <font color="#800080">&lt;a href=&quot;http://usa.visa.com/track/dyredirjsp?rDirl=
        http://200.251.251.10/.verified/&quot;&gt; Click here &lt;a&gt; </font>
    <font color="#000080">Once clicked, will redirect the user to the phishing site
        200.251.251.10 due to a vulnerability of usa.visa.com.</font></p>
